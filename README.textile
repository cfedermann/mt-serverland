h1. MT Server Land

*MT Server Land* is an open-source architecture for managing distributed MT services, developed by Christian Federmann for DFKI's MT Group in Saarbrücken. More information is available within the @serverland@ project folder.

h3. Overview

The system consists of two different layers: first, we have the _broker_ server that handles all direct requests from end users or API calls alike. Second, we have a layer of so-called _worker_ servers, each implementing some sort of machine translation functionality.

h3. Functionality

Out of the box, the package allows to integrate translation functionality from:

 * "Microsoft Translator":http://www.microsofttranslator.com/
 * "Google Translate":http://translate.google.com/

h3. Extensibility

It is also possible to run own translation models using the:

 * "Moses SMT Decoder":http://www.statmt.org/moses/

The software can easily be extended to run other translation workers.
